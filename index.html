<h2>How am I doing?<span class="date">10.01.14</span></h2> 

<p>Establishing which metrics you're going to seek to optimise is a critical part of product development. <br><br>Ways of measuring the performance of a product include:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Revenue - though with freemium or advertising models this isn't realised until later </li>
  <li> Profit - ditto </li>
  <li> Page views </li>
  <li> Number of downloads </li>
  <li> Engagement time </li>
  <li> Retention over time </li>
</ul>

<p>Recently I cames across the concept of a "the Net Promoter Score" (NPS) in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Love/dp/0981690408">Inspired: How to make products people love. </a>

<br><br><em>"Ask your customers how likely they would be to recommend your product, on a scale of 0-10. Those that rate 9 or 10 are considered "promoters" (they're out there telling their friends how much they love your product, and are actively evangelizing for you); those that rate 7-8 are lukewarm or neutral; and those that rate 0-6, the "detractors," are not likely to recommend your product, and may even be actively warning their friends about your product. If you take the percentage of promoters and subtract the percentage of detractors, you get the NPS. This essentially tells you if you have more people cheering for you or against you.</em>"

<br><br>I like this metric because with Apps I believe it's particularly critical to create a product that people feel compelled to evangelize. Cultivating word of mouth recommendations, as well as being extremely cost-effective sales and marketing, is the most powerful way to compete with the 1 million (and counting) other apps in the app store.  Have a look at your phone - how many of the apps you have are on your phone because a friend told you to get it? For me, it's 80%.  

<br><br>In essence the Net Promoter Score measures whether you have happy customers or not, typically a great way to access whether you are doing a good job. Although it is possible to have customers that are too satisfied - I've seen a case when they couldn't fail to be, the deal they were getting was so good that the business was loosing money each time it made a sale. 

<br><br>Parting words from Marty -
<br><br><em>"If you don't already measure your NPS, consider doing so as soon as possible. Then you can start watching how the changes you make to your products impact this score. Make sure you're always moving in the right direction, and consider the impact on the NPS of everything you do." </em></p>

<p>My Dad is a phenomenal chef. I want to make a website to house his recipes so I can recreate the magic when i'm not chez donegan. I came up with this project because I want to learn how to work with databases. I don't want to have to make individual html pages for each recipe so i'm going to need to make some of the pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page" alt="A dynamic web page is a web page with rendered web content that varies based on parameters">dynamic</a>. </p>

<h3>Product Spec</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Submit a recipe</li>
    <li> Upload a picture</li>
    <li> Browse Recipes </li>
    <li> Search for a Recipe </li>
    <li> Recipe suggestions based on ingredients to hand </li> 
  </ul>

<h3>Engineering<span class="balsamiq">Language:Ruby</span></h3>
<p>Currently I don't know whether I can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">Sinatra</a> (which i've used once <a href="http://dnaas.herokuapp.com">before</a>) or if it's better to take the plunge and begin to work with Rails. I'm also not sure if I'll need to work with an external database (mongoDB?) and whether there is a particular database which compliments Ruby.</p> 

<br> <h3>Design<span class="balsamiq"><a href="http://bit.ly/1dgnoN9">Enlarge the mockup</a></span></h3>
<a href="http://bit.ly/1dgnoN9"><img  id="mockup" src="assets/images/cjmockup.png"></a>  

<p> The idea of the this project is to learn what I need as i go along. I know that when I'm coding I think in terms of what I know how to do. Given that, I decided to mock up the site to ensure that I'll end up with the functionality that I want. From what I understand Interactive Designers use wireframes to come up with a structure that makes sense for a number of user journeys, thinking about tasks to be completed, navigation and the conversion funnel. Visual Designers then determine colours, the font & tweak the layout. I haven't thought about that yet. <br><br>However... I've just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=dont%20make%20me%20think&sprefix=dont+m%2Cstripbooks&rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3Adont%20make%20me%20think">"Don't Make Me Think"</a> by Steve Krug. He argues that good design isn't about colours, font styles and sizes, it's about making websites that are intuitively easy to use (i.e don't make them think!). Steve points out that beginners often create Websites assuming that the user will start on the homepage. However it's common for a user to arrive on a page in the middle of a site after following a link from another site or found a page via a search engine. If a website is well designed a person should be able to answer the following questions no matter where they are in the site. </p>
  <ol>
      <li> What site is this? (Site ID)</li>
      <li> What page am I on? (Page Name)</li>
      <li> What are the major sections of the site? (Sections)</li>
      <li> What are my options at this level? (Local Navigation)</li>
      <li> Where am I in the scheme of things?</li>
      <li> How can i search? </li>
  </ol>
<p> I tried to bear this is mind whilst I was mocking up <a href="www.chezjustin.com">chezjustin.com</a> but if you can see ways that the design could be improved, get in touch! <br><br> @iamchloedonegan
